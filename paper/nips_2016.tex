\section{Submission of papers to NIPS 2016}

\textbf{There is a new style file for papers submitted in 2016!}

NIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site
is
\begin{center}
  \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NIPS2016/}
\end{center}

Please read carefully the instructions below and follow them
faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2016 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
long, including figures. Since 2009 an additional ninth page
\emph{containing only acknowledgments and/or cited references} is
allowed. Papers that exceed nine pages will not be reviewed, or in any
other way considered for presentation at the conference.

The margins in 2016 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
$\sim$$15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+nips_2016.pdf+ contains these instructions and
illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
satisfy.

The only supported style file for NIPS 2016 is \verb+nips_2016.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
  2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The new \LaTeX{} style file contains two optional arguments:
\verb+final+, which creates a camera-ready copy, and \verb+nonatbib+,
which will not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of
package clash.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ option. This will
anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid review.  Please
do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will
be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+nips_2016.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
and text of the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
\ref{others} below.

\section{Method}

Previously Costa introduced a method %\cite{costa14} citations are not working oO
to learn how to construct novel graphs.
Graphs would be vectorized via a \emph{decomposition kernel}
to train a machine learning model (e.g. an SVM).
Also fragments of the Graphs would be collected in 
a \emph{grammar} (resembling a string grammar) to alter the 
set of Graphs incrementally. Changes to a graph are evaluated with the model. 
We present a method to increase the flexibility of the graph grammar.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%CONTINUE THE WRITING HERE! 
\textbf{Modification to the grammar.}
We work with different CIPs that consider a contracted version
of the original graphs. We obtain a contracted graph $G'$ by contracting edges in $G$.
After a contraction, the set of contracted vertices of the created vertex is accessible with the $contracted$ function.
We extract $C_{R}^v(G')$ and $I_{R,T}^v(G')$ as usual, but from $G'$. 
The core graph $C_{R}^v(G',G)$ is induced by the nodes $\bigcup\limits_{u \in C_R^v(G')} contracted(u)$.
The new interface graph $I_{R,B}^v(G',G)$ is then obtained by the nodes 
$\{ w | d(w,v) \leq B \wedge v\in C_R^v(G',G) \wedge w \in G \wedge w \notin C_R^v(G',G) \}$.
$B$ is the thickness of the base graph. 
At this point we can construct a CIP from $C_R^v(G',G)$ and $I_{R,B}^v(G',G)$. 
To find a congruent CIP, we previously only compared the hashed $I_{R,T}^v(G)$ graphs.
By hashing the hashes of $I_{R,T}^v(G')$ and $I_{R,B}^v(G,G')$ we increase the specificity 
of this comparison. The vertices in $I_{R,B}^v(G,G')$ might have been relabeled to represent a 
concept of its $contracted$ set. In our test, we will contract according to the secondary RNA structure
and label the resulting vertex accordingly e.g.'Hairpin loop'. This way we encode 
far reaching and abstract in our CIP interface matching.







% graph contration, interface trick


% change to congruency
\textbf{An improvement to the notion of congruency.}
For CIPs to be congruent, isomorphism is required. 
To cover some corner cases we expand this requirement to incorporate
the distance to nodes in the core graph when determining if graphs are isomorphic.
$\forall u \in I_{R,T}^v(G) : 
\underset{z \in  C_{R}^v(G)}{\min} d(u,z) = 
\underset{z' \in  C_{R}^{v'}(G')}{\min} d(\phi(u),z') $ i.e. the distance to the closest core node is equal for every
$u$ and $\phi(u)$.

\textbf{Extending what we can contract.}
Looking at edge contraction is only one way to obtain a contraction graph. 
One might also contract nodes that are not connected by an edge.
\textbf{??? what did i do exactly for the t-rna ???}
 







 


\newpage

\subsection{Definitions}
The vertices and edges of a graph $G=(V,E)$ are labeled.The function $label$
selects these labels. The isomorphism function for graphs is $\phi$.



\subsection{The grammar}
We build a grammar for graphs whose productions are similar to
productions of context sensitive string grammars.
We refer to Graph fragments as CIPs, \emph{core} and \emph{interface} pairs.
If the \emph{interfaces} of two fragments are \emph{congruent}, 
the \emph{core} can be replaced. Graph grammars are described in *somethin*.


\begin{figure}[h]

  %\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}  }
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/cip}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/isomorphsiam}
  \caption{1. A CIP being replaced in a graph core (red) are replaced iff interfaces	 
      (yellow) are isomorph \label{cip} 2.isomorphic but not congruent interfaces}
	
\end{figure}

In a Graph %-> defs $G=(V,E)$%
 we define a \emph{core} rooted in a node $v \in V$
as $C_R^v(G)$. It is the subgraph induced from $G$ with the nodes in $\{u|d(u,v)< R\}$.
We call R the radius. The Interface of the same CIP is defined by 
$I^v_{R,T}(G)$. It is the subgraph induced by the 
nodes in $ \{v \in C^v_{R+T} | v \notin C^v_{R}\} $.
The interface around a node $v$ consists of the nodes in radius $R+T$ minus the core
region.$T$ is the thickness around the core graph.

In Fig.\ref{cip} we can see how a production will be applied in the graph generation 
phase. Once a root node is selected, the CIP that is to be replaced determined quickly.


Finding a replacement CIP requires the interface of that CIP to be at least 
isomorphic. Hashing the interface makes it easy to find congruent CIPs.
We call this hash $L^g(G)$. It will later be 
hashed by a (Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd \cite{damgard} type) hash function $H$.
To compute $L^g(G)$, we first assign 
a new label $nl(v)$ to each node $v$. 
We do this by sorting the set $ \{ (d(v,u),label(u)) | u \in G \} $
lexicographically. For each edge $(u,v)$ in $G$ we can now 
list the triplets $<label((u,v),nl(u),nl(v))>$ and sort them lexicographically.
%The $label$ function just selects the label assigned to the element.
%-> moved to definitionsEvery vertex and edge in Graphs are required to be labeled.



  











%CIPs are extracted from every node in every graph in the input.

\section{Evaluation}



\section{Discussion??}
 
 


 
 
  



\section{soemthing something}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
(9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
\nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
\nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
list both author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2016+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2016}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
number and title always appear before the table.  See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
  rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule{1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
(except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
note that pages should be numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level
heading for the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to \verb+small+ (9 point) when listing the references. {\bf
  Remember that you can use a ninth page as long as it contains
  \emph{only} cited references.}
